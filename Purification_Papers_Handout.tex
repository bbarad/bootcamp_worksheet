  \maketitle
  Each of the papers that you are reading focus on expressing, purifying and analyzing a protein or complex. These are a few guiding questions to help you prepare presentations on the expression and purification strategies utilized in your paper.
  \begin{enumerate}
    
    \item What biological compound is being studied in this paper?
    \item What techniques did the authors use to express and purify the compound?
    \item Why did the authors choose to use these techniques? In other words, what makes this purification strategy preferable?
    \item What are some downsides of this approach? What are the limitations of the techniques being used?
    \item What would be a good alternative workflow?
    \item As a though experiment, design an experiment using some or all of the techniques the authors used to express and purify a protein that you are interested in.

  \end{enumerate}
