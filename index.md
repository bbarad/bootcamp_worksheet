...

Each of the papers that you are reading focus on expressing, purifying
and analyzing a protein or complex. These are a few guiding questions to
help you prepare presentations on the expression and purification
strategies utilized in your paper.

1.  What biological compound is being studied in this paper?

2.  What techniques did the authors use to express and purify the
    compound?

3.  Why did the authors choose to use these techniques? In other words,
    what makes this purification strategy preferable?

4.  What are some downsides of this approach? What are the limitations
    of the techniques being used?

5.  What would be a good alternative workflow?

6.  As a though experiment, design an experiment using some or all of
    the techniques the authors used to express and purify a protein that
    you are interested in.
