<p>Each of the papers that you are reading focus on expressing, purifying and analyzing a protein or complex. These are a few guiding questions to help you prepare presentations on the expression and purification strategies utilized in your paper.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>What biological compound is being studied in this paper?</p></li>
<li><p>What techniques did the authors use to express and purify the compound?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did the authors choose to use these techniques? In other words, what makes this purification strategy preferable?</p></li>
<li><p>What are some downsides of this approach? What are the limitations of the techniques being used?</p></li>
<li><p>What would be a good alternative workflow?</p></li>
<li><p>As a though experiment, design an experiment using some or all of the techniques the authors used to express and purify a protein that you are interested in.</p></li>
